    I’ve been part of building a complete e-commerce frontend from scratch, contributing both to core functionality and the overall user experience. I developed the entire filters system for category and search pages, including mobile and desktop layouts, active filters logic, range filters, and async product count updates.
I also worked on dynamic product boxes, adapting them to product availability and discounts, and contributed to the multi-level main menu for smooth navigation. Along the way, I built reusable UI components such as dropdowns, form validators, and various interactive features that improved the shop’s usability.
